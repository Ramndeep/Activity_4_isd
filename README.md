## Additional Information

In PySide6, the signal-slot mechanism connects actions like button clicks to specific functions, making the app responsive and interactive. Itâ€™s also important for me to keep the CSV file structure consistent, with clear headers like Task and Status, to avoid loading issues. To take the app further, I could add features like deleting tasks, filtering by status, or sorting options to organize tasks more easily. These extra touches not only enhance usability but also give me a chance to deepen my skills with PySide6 and data handling in Python.
